# üîë Key features
- **Subject-Oriented**: Organized around subjects like sales, products, or customers.
- **Integrated**: Data is consistent across all subjects.
- **Time-Variant**: Historical data is kept for analysis over time.
- **Non-Volatile**: Once data is in the warehouse, it doesn't change. (just keep appending)

---

# What is a data mart?
- A subset of the data warehouse
- Normally related to a specific team in the business (for example marketing)
- Only provides the data related to this business unit

---

# Why do we break down the warehouse like this?
- **Performance**: Faster query performance due to reduced data volume.
- **Agility**: Quicker to build and modify.
- **User-Friendly**: Tailored to specific business unit needs, making it more intuitive.

---

# Okay but how do we actually go about building our warehouse and marts?

- **Requirements analysis:** what do the stakeholders want to derive from the data? 
- **Understand your sources**: find all of the companies data. Work out what is useful and what is not
- **Data Modeling**: decide how you are going to model the data

---

# Inmon approach
Bill Inmon is the father of data warehousing

<img src="/inmon.png" alt="Inmon"/>


---

# How?
- Normalized to the third normal form (3NF)
- Create the data warehouse
- Then build the marts ‚û°Ô∏è top down approach

---

<img src="/top_vs_bottom_wh.png" alt="Data Warehousing graph"/>

---

# Normalized (Inmon)
- **Normalized**
- **Single source of truth** for the entire organization
- **Robust to business changes** 
- Upfront investment in planning and resources
- **Querying becomes challenging** ==> a lot of joins

---

---

# Four-step dimensional design process
1. Select the business process
2. Declare the grain
3. Identify the dimensions
4. Identify the facts

---


# Steps
1. Identify a fact
2. Determine dimensions (attributes and descriptions around a fact)
3. Create mart - which we want our end users to interact with more 

üí° The combination of a fact table with several dimension tables is called the star schema

---

# Facts

| Date       | CampaignName | Impressions | Clicks | Conversions | Spend |
|------------|--------------|-------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 2023-09-10 | Summer Sale  | 10,000      | 1,000  | 100         | $500  |
| 2023-09-11 | Fall Launch  | 15,000      | 1,500  | 150         | $750  |

<br>

- Low granularity
- Contains identifiers that allow you to join with dimension tables
- Numeric Values

---

# Granularity
- Most important design step is declaring the fact able grain
- The business definition of what a single fact table record represents
- Build it on the **lowest possible grain**, meaning it cannot be divided any further
- Once the data is aggregated, you can not disaggregate it to a finer level

---

# Dimension table structure

| CampaignName | StartDate  | EndDate    | TargetAudience | Channel  |
|--------------|------------|------------|----------------|----------|
| Summer Sale  | 2023-09-01 | 2023-09-30 | Ages 18-25     | Facebook |
| Fall Launch  | 2023-09-10 | 2023-10-10 | Ages 25-35     | Email    |

<br>

- Will add context to a fact through attributes & descriptions
- Can be slowly changing, e.g. office location for an employee ‚ùì How do you handle that?
- Has a single primary key column
- Embedded as a foreign key in an associated fact table
- Usually flat, wide denormalized tables 
- Need a surrogate key, as dimension values can be updated. They can be simple integers

---

# Kimball

In this simplified model:
- The Campaign Performance table provides **metrics** on how each campaign performed on a given date.
- The Campaign Details table provides **additional context** about each campaign, such as its duration, target audience, and channel.

Allows marketing teams to quickly see how each campaign is performing and understand the context behind each campaign.

---

# ‚ùì What are the benefits?
- Simple
- Query simplicity
- Great for analysis (focus on the BI side)

---

# Conformed dimensions (used for integrating data)
- One dimension might be able to be joined with multiple facts table
- Guarantees that a single data item is used in a similar manner across all the facts
- Ensures that all departments work with the same data definitions
- Example: 'Customer ID' means the same thing across all the different datasets

--- 

# Surrogate key
- Unique records for records in a dimension table
- Data in dimension tables can change over time (slowy changing dimensions), surrogate keys provide a consistent and unchanging reference to each record

---

# Slowly changing dimensions

- How do you track changes in the dimension data stored in a data warehouse?
- There are different types of SCD's:
    - Type 1: Overwrite old data with new data
    - Type 2: keep historical data by adding new records with updated info
    - Type 3: Store the original and the current values in the same record

---

# Type 2

Example: An employee named John, with EmployeeID = 123, moves from 'Office A' to 'Office B'. Here's how you might implement this change with a SQL query:

First, update the current record for John to set its EndDate to the current date, indicating the end of this record's validity.

```sql
UPDATE Employee
SET EndDate = CURRENT_DATE
WHERE EmployeeID = 123 AND EndDate IS NULL;
```

Insert a new record with the updated info:

```sql
INSERT INTO Employee (EmployeeID, EmployeeName, OfficeLocation, StartDate, EndDate)
VALUES (123, 'John', 'Office B', CURRENT_DATE, NULL);
```

---

# Data Quality
- Test for uniqueness of the primary key and the surrogate key
- **Referential integrity**, make sure that all foreign keys in the fact table reference existing primary keys in the dimension tables
- Range or Domain Validity

---

# Junk dimensions
- Used to handle and store miscellaneous data
- Common attributes are "IsPromotionalSale", "IsOnlinePurchase", or "HasWarranty"
- Do not want to place these in the facts table

---

# Create Marts
- Join facts & dims to create custom views/tables
- e.g. see total orders by product, customer etc.
- Used for reporting and analytics

---

# Benefits
- Common approach, well-documented & time-tested
- Capable of handling complex scenarios
- Provides clarity & stability to a data warehouse
- Fast to construct, no normalization required
- Easily to comprehened, simplifying querying and analysis

# Disadvantages
- Data isn't entirely integrated before reporting: no single source of truth
- Redundant data can be added to tables

---

# ‚ùì Which one do you choose?

---

# Time to value ‚è∞

**Kimball**:
- Faster initial results due to focus on specific business needs.
- Delivers value iteratively.

**Inmon**:
- Longer initial setup due to comprehensive EDW design.
- Value realized when EDW is established and data marts are derived.

---

# Complexity & Integration ‚öôÔ∏è

**Kimball**:
- Initial setup is simpler.
- Complexity can arise when integrating multiple data marts.

**Inmon**:
- Initial design is complex due to enterprise-wide considerations.
- Integration is inherent, as data marts are derived from a unified EDW.

---

# Flexibility vs. Consistency üí™

**Kimball**:
- More flexible to departmental needs.
- Risk of inconsistencies across data marts.

**Inmon**:
- Consistent data model across the organization.
- Less flexibility for department-specific nuances.

---

# Maintenance & Scalability üë©‚Äçüîß

**Kimball**:
- Maintenance can be challenging when integrating or changing multiple data marts.
- Scalable in terms of adding new data marts.

**Inmon**:
- Centralized maintenance at the EDW level.
- Scalability requires changes to the central EDW, but data marts can be easily derived.
